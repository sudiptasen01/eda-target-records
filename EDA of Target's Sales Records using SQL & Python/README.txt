🛒 E-commerce Data Analysis Project (Python + SQL)
📌 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to explore and analyze an e-commerce company’s sales and customer data to uncover actionable insights around customer behavior, revenue trends, and operational performance. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making across retention, sales strategy, and performance optimization.

🧪 Process Overview
🔹 Data Extraction
Connected to a MySQL database containing multi-table e-commerce data such as orders, customers, products, and transactions.

Used complex SQL joins and filtering to extract clean, analysis-ready datasets.

🔹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
Performed data wrangling using pandas to handle missing values, merge related tables, and ensure consistency.

Created custom metrics like:

Monthly Revenue

Average Order Value (AOV)

Repeat Purchase Rate

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Used matplotlib and seaborn to visualize key sales and customer behavior trends.

Analyzed revenue by product category, customer segments, and time to identify growth opportunities.

Identified high-value customers, peak sales periods, and underperforming product categories.

📊 Results & Insights
Discovered that a small percentage of customers contributed to a majority of revenue, emphasizing the importance of retention strategies.

Identified seasonality in sales and the impact of promotional periods on revenue spikes.

Found that certain product categories had high cart abandonment rates, signaling areas for UX or pricing improvements.

Highlighted churn risks and formulated retention metrics based on customer repurchase behavior.
